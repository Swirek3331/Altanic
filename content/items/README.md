What do you want?
Just items I can only explain what items will be or are doing.

## The Items

### Coal Coke

Better coal made by usisng pyrolyse on coal.
Has nearly the same explosivity as regular coal, but is more flammable.

### Feco

Look at periodic table, at fourth line.
Iron (Fe) and cobal (Co), get it?
In my native language it is `zekoba`, first part is from iron `Å¼elazo`, second from cobalt `kobalt`.

### Wall-Alloy

Like steel but it's perpouse is being a material for walls.
