## Not Items

Coal and spore pod have their files located here.
But this is only to change their flammability.

## The Items

### Coal Coke ![coal-coke](/sprites/items/coal-coke.png)

Better coal made by usisng pyrolyse on coal.
Has nearly the same explosivity as regular coal, but is more flammable.

### Feco ![feco](/sprites/items/feco.png)

Look at periodic table, at fourth line.
Iron (Fe) and cobalt (Co), get it?
In my native language it is `zekoba`, first part is from iron `żelazo`, second from cobalt `kobalt`.
**Feco is planed to be a mid game item**
Ore texutre will be changed many times.
Original texture used back in fist altanic (extended-wall-pack or dzban's-industry back then) was made by Not_Bot#5078, he also has chosen color pallet for it.

### Wall-Alloy ![wall-alloy](/sprites/items/wall-alloy.png)

Like steel but it's main perpouse is being a material for walls.
**Conected to [feco](#feco-feco)**
First texture of this, called stell back then, was also made by person above, but the new one was made by me. Originaly as a `brąz szklany` for [Z.P.G.M._MOD](https://github.com/r-omnom/Z.P.G.M._Mod) and here, I have only changed colors.

### Wood ![wood](/sprites/items/wood.png)

Is this hard to understand?

### Calcium Carbonate

Or limestone.
Used as flux in feco metallurgy to save up more electricity.
Can be obtained from calcite.

### Petroleum Coke

Carbon rich fuel that will be obtained from heavy oil.
Can Be used in feco metallurgy.

### Biomass

After first Altanic I have came to a conlusion that better will be to make biomass as one item and diffrent recepises to obtain it.
Recepises represents plant.
Previously what I did was four or five items.
