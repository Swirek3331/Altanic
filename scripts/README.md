## Multicrafters

<https://liplum.github.io/MultiCrafterLib/>
I have planed that mutlicrafters will be in one file sotred by category chronology.
I hope that possible will be editing this by other mods.
Actual blocks will be something like this:

- ### Crafting

      - #### Electric Furnace

    Combination of all basic smelters.
    Level of complex: Silicon/metaglass.

      - #### Induction Smelter

    More complex version of above.
    Level of complex: thorium/plastanium

      - #### Arc Furnace

    Propably the most complext one.
    Level of complex: surge-alloy/phase-fabric?

      - #### Blast Furnace

    ~~Stell~~ Feco manufacture.
    Level of complex: metaglass/graphite
